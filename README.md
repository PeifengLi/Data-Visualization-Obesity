# Data-Visualization-Obesity
Our project is mainly focus on the obesity issue in the world. We will analyze the topic by exploring 2 dataset - one is the share of death related to obesity across the world, another dataset we will dive deep to figure out the key effects that may lead to obesity.We hope we can tell a story and educate people to obtain a healthier lifestyle to prevent obesity.

## Datasets
- The data set contains the [country's share of death related to obesity from 1990 to 2017](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-deaths-obesity?tab=chart&time=1990..latest)
### Data set information
